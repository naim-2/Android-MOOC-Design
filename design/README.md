# Android-MOOC-Design
The application allows users to get details about countries in the world as well as getting cat photos which are randomly generated from external APIs. 

### Figma Design Link:

### The URLs I'll be connecting to are: 
i.	For country search: https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/ 
Example: https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/united%20states%20of%20america 
...will return a few details about United States of America.
ii.	For cat image generator: https://api.thecatapi.com/v1/images/search 
This should get a random JSON which then extracts the URL to display the image using technologies like Picasso.
